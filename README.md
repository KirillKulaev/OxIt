# OxIt
This is a mini python library designed to predict (calculate) the most probable oxidized form *(by radical mechanism)* of molecules based on SMILES. The library is essentially a wrapper over xtb and crest that runs a cascade of calculations such as conformational search, geometric optimization, energy calculations of oxidized and intermediate forms, also calculate some molecular properties to help characterize the process.
